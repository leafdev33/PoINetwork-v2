**PoI System: Block, Blockchain, and Test Files**


This document provides an explanation of the current functionality for the Block.py, Blockchain.py, and test_blockchain.py files in the context of a Proof of Interaction (PoI) system. The Interaction class is designed to handle interactions between nodes in the system, and the Block and Blockchain classes provide a structure for storing those interactions in a blockchain.

Block.py


The Block class represents a block in the PoI system's blockchain. Each block stores a collection of interactions, and the blocks are connected in a chain using a hash function. The class provides the following features:

- Store an index, timestamp, list of interactions, previous block's hash, and the block's own hash
- Calculate the block's hash based on its data (index, timestamp, interactions, and previous block's hash)
- Note that the Block class does not handle consensus, block validation, or interaction verification.

**Blockchain.py**

The Blockchain class represents the PoI system's blockchain. It maintains a list of blocks and provides the following features:

- Create a genesis block (first block in the chain)
- Get the last block in the chain
- Add a new block to the chain with a list of interactions

**This current version of the Blockchain class does not handle:**

Consensus mechanisms
Blockchain validation or block validation
Interaction validation or signature verification

**test_blockchain.py**

The test_blockchain.py file contains unit tests for the Block and Blockchain classes. It verifies their functionality in conjunction with the Interaction class. The test file checks:

- Block hash calculation
- Block index and previous hash correctness
- Adding blocks with interactions to the blockchain
- Genesis block properties
- Current PoI System Capabilities

The current implementation of the PoI system includes the Interaction, Block, and Blockchain classes. At this stage, it is capable of:

- Creating, signing, and verifying interactions
- Storing interactions in a block
- Adding blocks to a blockchain

However, the current version does not yet include:

- A network layer for communication between nodes
- A consensus mechanism for determining the validity of blocks and interactions
- A mechanism for rewarding nodes based on their interactions and reputation
- A full PoI node implementation, including key management, reputation updates, and network integration
